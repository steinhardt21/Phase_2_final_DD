intro: From 2016 the Snapchat “Dog Filter” feature has been controversially dubbed “Hoe Filter” due to its apparent promiscuity and its widespread usage among young women. Given that Twitter was the platform where the discussion was born and widely spread, it was used as the primary tool to approach the issue. The relevance of the debate lies underneath meme culture, where an apparently harmless feature reveals different sociological implications.
